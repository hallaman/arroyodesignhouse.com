        <p class="space">If you are interested in purchasing an ARROYO piece &mdash; or want to talk about a custom project, we’d love to hear from you! The best place to start would be to send us an email at <a href="mailto:chrismsjohnston@gmail.com">chrismsjohnston@gmail.com</a>. </p>

        <p class="inquiry"><img src="/assets/images/middle_diamond.png" />Want to buy an existing piece?</p>

        <p>If you would like to purchase a piece from the site &mdash; just let us know. If the piece is available, we can arrange local delivery. If you’d like something from our portfolio that needs to be built, we’ll get back to you to with pricing information and a timeline. <p>

        <p class="inquiry"><img src="/assets/images/middle_diamond.png" />Want to alter an existing piece?</p>

        <p>If you decide you’re interested in something similar to a piece we’ve already created but you’d like to change a few of the details &mdash; shoot us an email, we promise we won’t be offended. The most common changes are typically selecting a different wood species or altering the dimensions.  </p>

        <p class="inquiry"><img src="/assets/images/middle_diamond.png" />Want a custom piece?</p>

        <p>If you know what you’re looking for please email any details, links, or images that can be used for reference. If you’ve got a loose idea, or would like more help bringing your idea(s) to life &mdash; we’d be happy to set up a call or meet in person to work through the design and quoting process. </p>

        <p class="inquiry"><img src="/assets/images/middle_diamond.png" />Want a custom piece but not exactly sure what you're looking for?</p>

        <p>If you are interested in a custom piece, or you have a space in your home that you’re just not sure what to do with &mdash; we’d love to help. If and when it makes sense, we do offer house calls. Seeing the space in person is often the best way to start the design process.  </p>

        <p class="space">All ARROYO products are made by hand in our Boise wood shop. We take pride in designing and creating heirloom quality pieces that will last for generations. That said, we are still just a husband and wife team &mdash; therefore our clients can expect custom work to take anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks.  </p>
